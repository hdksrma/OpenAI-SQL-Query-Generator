# SQL Query Generator

The SQL Query Generator is a project that allows non-technical users to interact with SQL databases using natural language inputs. This project was built using OpenAI's completion API and Python, and can be run in a Jupyter Notebook.

## Getting Started

To use the SQL Query Generator, you will need to have a Jupyter Notebook environment set up on your machine. You will also need to have an API key from OpenAI to use their completion API.

Once you have these prerequisites, you can clone the project code from this GitHub repository and open the SQL_Query_Generator.ipynb file in your Jupyter Notebook environment.

## Usage

To use the SQL Query Generator, follow these steps:

1. Start by providing a natural language input in the provided cell.

2. Run the cell to generate a SQL query based on your input.

3. Use the generated query to interact with your SQL database as needed.
